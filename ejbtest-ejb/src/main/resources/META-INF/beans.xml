    <!--
         Second apporach for dissambiguating between:
          - concrete impl of the interface
          - and the @Produced service instance in ServiceProvider
         (First approach is to use a @Mark in the @Producer method, and the same @Mark in the @Injected field.)

         This ambigous situation is because we whant to @Inject the looked up @Local @EJB instance, 
         instead of relaying just in @Inject.

         Important note: If we just use @Inject, without @Producing an instance with the lookedup @Local @EJB,
         CDI @Injects the service impl instance, but if this service is also exposed with 
         a @Remote interface, and it is lookedup, and used as @Remote, we 'sometimes' have a remote 
         behaiviour with the CDI @Injected instance.
